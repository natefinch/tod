Laurence Sirgiu is a human fighter.

His parents were farmers.  They lived on the edge of the farms and wildlands.
One day a traveling group of entertainers came through, regaling the local folk
with tales of the ruteloy.  No one really knew what it was, but they wanted it.
His parents became obsessed with the search for the ruteloy.

Soon after, his parents left him and his siblings behind.  Laurence is sure that
they went off in search of the ruteloy, and has been searching for them for 5
years.  The latest clue had it in or near Greenest, and so he hired {{%lnk hazel%}} to
help him find it.  He believes that if he can find the ruteloy, he will find his
parents.
