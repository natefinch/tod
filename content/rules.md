## Character Generation

4d6, drop the lowest 6 times.  If you don't like your scores, you can use the default array (15 14 13 12 10 8).

Don't be evil.

## Roll Up a New Character

If your character dies, you may make a new character with the same XP total.
You must, however, reroll your stats (though you may still use the default array
if you don't like your new rolls).

## Optional Rules

We will be using feats.

Humans may take the variant abilities: +1 to two stats and a feat at first level.

## House Rules

None, so far.
