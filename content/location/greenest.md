Scatterheart passed away without ever achieving that level of eminence, but her town grew into a thriving community.  Its success isn't surpising, since Greenest is the only town of any size astride the Uldoon Trail, the most direct road between the eastern cities of the Dragon Coast, Cormyr, and Sembia with the Coast Way running south to the great cities of Amn, Tethyr, and far Calimshan.  The trade catavans that pass through Greenest bring gold to the town's merchants and craftsfolk, and {{% lnk nighthill %}} runs the town at the behest of the inhabitants.
